# Notes App

### Summary
A note-taking single page app (SPA) created with vanilla Javascript and my own testing framework.

### Objectives

Develop an application using only pure JavaScript (with the exception of the npm package http-server package to serve the app) where a user can:
* Add a note
* See a list of notes already added (cut down to the first 20 characters of each note)
* Viewing the entire body of a note
* Build my own testing framework to be able to utilize feature and unit tests needed, allowing me to employ TDD to drive the development of my application

### How to use
1. Clone this repo

2. In Terminal, run:

* `npm install` to install the node packages
* `http-server` to boot the local server
* Visit the localhost address (e.g. http://localhost:8080)
